# **Overview**
As a software engineer passionate about modern web and mobile development, I'm building a task management application that explores full-stack architecture patterns. This project represents my ongoing journey to understand how to create robust, scalable backend systems that can power both web and mobile experiences.
The current implementation features a fully functional Hello World API built with TypeScript and Express, serving as the foundation for what will become a comprehensive task management system. I've structured the backend to support clean RESTful endpoints that can be seamlessly consumed by different client platforms, with special attention to proper CORS configuration for cross-platform compatibility.

# **Purpose**
I created this software to dive deep into enterprise-style backend architecture and really understand what it takes to build production-ready APIs. There's something satisfying about seeing that **"Hello World"** response come through not just in a browser, but also on mobile devices through the React Native app I'm building alongside this backend.

What excites me most is laying the groundwork for features I'll add later - custom authentication systems, task CRUD operations, and device management. I've been particularly focused on getting the TypeScript configuration just right and ensuring my middleware setup handles errors gracefully. The CORS configuration was especially interesting to work through, making sure both Android emulators and physical devices can communicate with the backend seamlessly.

This isn't just about making something work - it's about building it properly from the ground up. I want to understand not just how to write code that functions, but how to structure it in a way that's maintainable, testable, and ready to scale when I add more complex features down the line

# **Development Environment**
I developed this software using the following tools and technologies:
•	Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment
•	TypeScript - Typed superset of JavaScript for improved development experience
•	Express.js - Web application framework for building RESTful APIs
•	PostgreSQL - Relational database management system
•	Neon - Serverless PostgreSQL platform for cloud database hosting
•	Visual Studio Code - Code editor with excellent TypeScript support
•	Postman - API testing and development tool

# **Programing Language**
The programming language used is TypeScript, which provides static typing, better tooling, and improved code maintainability compared to plain JavaScript.

# **Notes**
- The API is currently running locally and has been successfully consumed by an Android  emulator and a physical device.
- This setup serves as the **foundation for future features**, such as user authentication, task CRUD operations, and mobile push notifications.

# **Test Project**
### Backend: 
**npm run dev**
**Web:** http://localhost:3000/api/hello

### Android Mobile Device:
**Android Emulator and Device:** http://192.168.0.197:3000/api/hello
- Replace **192.168.0.197** with your IP address. 
- Run **ipconfig** on your Command Prompt terminal CMD to get your IP address 
- Use same network (Wi-Fi / hotspot) on your PC and android device
